Part of ethnocentrism is the belief that one’s own race, ethnic or cultural group is the most important or that some or all aspects of its culture are superior to those of other groups.

        Content: "UNDERSTANDING CULTURE, SOCIAL AND POLIITCS Ethnocentrism in social science and anthropology—as well as in colloquial English discourse—means to apply one's own culture or ethnicity as a frame of reference to judge other cultures, practices, behaviors, beliefs, and people, instead of using the standards of the particular culture involved. ICultural relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture. Proponents of cultural relativism also tend to argue that the norms and values of one culture should not be evaluated using the norms and values of another."

It is often determined by a person's place of birth, naturalization, or other legal criteria established by a nation's government. Nationality is an important aspect of a person's identity, as it can have various legal, social, and cultural implications, including the rights and responsibilities one has within a specific country. Nationality can affect a person's ability to vote, work, access government services, and travel across international borders, among other things. It is distinct from ethnicity, which is related to a person's cultural and sometimes ancestral background."
