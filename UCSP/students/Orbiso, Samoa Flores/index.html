<p style="background-color:yellow;">
Humans first evolved in Africa, and much of human evolution occurred on that continent. The fossils of early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years ago come entirely from Africa. Most scientists currently recognize some 15 to 20 different species of early humans.

<h1 style="background-color:green;">CULTURAL RELATIVISM</h1>

<p style="background-color:red;">
Cultural Relativism

• The objective analysis of other cultures - understanding a culture's beliefs and practices from that culture's point of view.

Cultural Relativism is not about imposing judgement or assessing the worth of other cultures. This is ethnocentrism.

• For example, can we judge the wearing of the burqa in Islamic communities, simply because it differs from Western ideas about femininity?
