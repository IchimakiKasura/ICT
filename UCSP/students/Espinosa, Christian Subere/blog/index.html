<h1 style="background-color:aqua;text-align: right;">Ethnocentrism, in contrast to cultural relativism, is the tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one’s own culture.</h1>
<h1 style="background-color: aqua;text-align: right;">Ethnocentrism often entails the belief that one’s own race or ethnic group is the most important or that some or all aspects of its culture are superior to those of other groups.</h1>
<h1 style="background-color: aqua;text-align: right;">Within this ideology, individuals will judge other groups in relation to their own particular ethnic group or culture, especially with concern to language, behavior, customs, and religion.<h1>
<h1 style="background-color: aqua;text-align: right;">Cultural relativism is the belief that the concepts and values of a culture cannot be fully translated into, or fully understood in, other languages; that a specific cultural artifact (e.g., a ritual) has to be understood in terms of the larger symbolic system of which it is a part.</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:silver;text-align: right;">Subsequently, the Enlightenment will affirm the triumph of reason and will be the measure of all progress that justified Western colonialism.

Along with this, another more specific definition of ethnocentrism develops, namely “Eurocentrism”, by which the European was considered the model of “civilized man”. </h1>
<h1 style="background-color:silver;text-align: right;">In the following years, until the beginning of the nineteenth century, pseudoscientific evidence will support several data that will allow the establishment of an evolutionary line of culture in stages: wild, barbaric and civilized.

Similarly, scientific racism will constitute an ideology of white superiority. At that time, being white and European was considered the maximum of cultural and social evolution on the planet.</h1>
