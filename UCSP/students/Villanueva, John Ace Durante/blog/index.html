<h1 style="background-color:red;">TECHNOLOGICAL HUMANS EVOLUTION</h1>

<p style="background-color:orange;">Technology is progressing rapidly, and it is changing the way we live, work and play. New inventions are happening, and new paradigms are born almost every day. Conventional concepts we are used to as a human race for decades or even centuries are being disrupted by cutting edge technology.

<h1 style="background-color:orange;">Music, like every other aspect, has been evolving since it was discovered. Its origins can be traced back over a million years to the beginning of human evolution. Scientists believe that the shared ancestors of Neanderthals and modern humans had the vocal anatomy to "sing" like us, but no one knows for sure if they did or not.

    Bipedalism evolution fossils suggest that, bipedality may have begun as early as 6 million years ago. But it was with Australopithecus, an early hominin who evolved in Southern and Eastern Africa between 4 and 2 million years ago, that our ancestors took their first steps as committed bipeds.
