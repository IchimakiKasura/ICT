						<h3 style="color:darkred;"><i>Human Evolution is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to 
						the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, which includes all the great apes. This process involved
						the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism, dexterity and complex language, as well as interbreeding with other 
						hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily), indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike. The study of human
						evolution involves several scientific disciplines, including physical and evolutionary anthropology, paleontology, and genetics.

					in which they are living. Darwin’s theory was that organisms evolve as a result of many slight changes over the course of time. 
					In this article, we will discuss evolution during pre-human times and human prehistory. During prehistory, writing was not yet developed.
					But much important information on prehistory is obtained through studies of the fossil record

					<h3 style="color:darkred;"><i><b>Text input is certainly useful, but images and speech are a much more natural way for humans to express
					their queries. Infants learn to see and speak well before they learn to type. The same is true of human evolution - we've had spoken 
					languange for a long time compared to written language, which is a relatively recent development.
