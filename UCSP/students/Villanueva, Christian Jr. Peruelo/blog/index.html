<img src='myimages/society.png' alt="" width="550" height="600"
<bold><p style="text-align:center;">A society is a group of people participating in continuous social connection, or a broad social group occupying the same social or spatial territory, normally exposed to the same political power and cultural standards that are dominant.</p></bold>
<strong><h1 style="text-align:center;">Culture</h1></strong>
<img src'myimages/culture.png' width="550" height="600"
<bold><p style="tex-align:center;">Culture can be defined as all the ways of life including arts, beliefs and institutions of a population that are passed down from generation to generation. Culture has been called "the way of life for an entire society." As such, it includes codes of manners, dress, language, religion, rituals, art.</p></bold>
<strong><h1 style="text-align:center;">Cultural Behavior</h1></strong>
