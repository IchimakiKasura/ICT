        <h2>GENDER AND SEXUALITY</h2>
        <p>Gender and sexuality are complex and diverse aspects of human identity, encompassing a wide range of experiences and expressions that are deeply intertwined with culture, society, and individual self-identification.</p>

    <div style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>"Gender and sexuality are not boxes to check; they are facets of our identity that should be embraced, celebrated, and respected in all their beautiful diversity."</h2>
        <p>Both gender and sexuality are deeply personal and can play a significant role in shaping an individual's sense of self and identity. It's important to recognize that these concepts are diverse and can vary from person to person. Additionally, they should be respected and acknowledged with sensitivity to promote inclusivity and understanding.</p>
