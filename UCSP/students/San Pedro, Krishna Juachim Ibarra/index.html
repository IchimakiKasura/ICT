<h1 style="background-color:white;">ETHNOCENTRISM</h1>

<p style="background-color:white;">
Ethnocentric people think the ways they do things is the way things should be done, and every other culture's way of doing things is unsavory or undesirable.

Ethnocentrism can be a contributing factor to prejudice, racism, and xenophobia. In all these instances, you're considering yourself and your culture to be the best compared to all others.

<h1 style="background-color:red;">CULTURAL RELATIVISM</h1>

<p style="background-color:white;">
Cultural Relativism

• The objective analysis of other cultures - understanding a culture's beliefs and practices from that culture's point of view.

Cultural Relativism is not about imposing judgement or assessing the worth of other cultures. This is ethnocentrism.

• For example, can we judge the wearing of the burqa in Islamic communities, simply because it differs from Western ideas about femininity?
