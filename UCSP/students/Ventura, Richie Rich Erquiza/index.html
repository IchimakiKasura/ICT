	<h2>CULTURAL VARIATION</h2>
	</marquee>
	

			<p style="text-align: center;">The relates to the wide variety of social practices that are displayed by many civilizations worldwide. In addition to gender roles, economic structures, and social hierarchies, a wide range of other humanly structured activities also vary from one culture to the next. Studies of cultural diversity can be conducted inside a culture (such as a cross-cultural examination of ritual in Brazil and Indonesia) or between generations (such as a comparison of Generation X and Generation Y). Anthropologists, sociologists, and cultural theorists with expertise in economic anthropology, ethnomusicology, health sociology, etc. frequently study this topic. Neuroanthropology, cultural neuroscience, and social neuroscience have all recently turned to cultural variation as a rich research area.</p>

	<h2>THE ASPECTS OF CULTURAL VARIATION</h2>
	</marquee>

	<h3><i>SUBCULTURE</i></h3>

	<p style="text-align: center;">A subculture is a group individuals who distinguish themselves from the traditional and conservative ideals to which they belong, frequently retaining some of its basic principles. When it comes to issues of culture, politics, and sexuality, subcultures create their own standards and morals. The subcultures are seen as instantiating elements in the most current analyses. They define subcultures as collectivities that, on a cultural level, are sufficiently homogeneous internally and heterogeneous with respect to the outside world to be able to develop, as Paul Hodkinson points out, consistent distinctiveness, identity, commitment, and autonomy in an effort to dispel the idea that subcultures are manifestations of deviance or resistance.</p>

	<h3><i>COUNTERCULTURE</i></h3>

	<p style="text-align: center;">A counterculture is a community that has views and behavioral norms that are significantly at odds with those of mainstream society, at times to the point of being diametrically opposed. A countercultural movement represents the ideals and goals of a certain group of people in a clearly defined time period.</p>

	<h3><i>ETHNOCENTRISM</i></h3>

	<p style="text-align: center;">The practice where we tend to believe that our own culture, ethnic group, race, etc. are superior to others. Such a belief develops out of socialization, which provides us the knowledge of the existence of different cultures, and that of our own, what these cultures entail, what is normal, what is different, what is right or what is wrong. Ethnocentrism is often a judgment that we make based on our own culture, we tend to believe that what we practice in our own culture is right, as opposed to the practices of the other cultures, it is a kind of cultural relativism where we are comparing our own culture to the other while at the same time keeping the focus on our own culture. We all learn ethnocentrism while growing up, as the practices of our own culture are normalized to us, we automatically tend to start assuming any practice that is not a part of our culture is not normal.</p>

	<h3><i>CULTURAL RELAVATISM</i></h3>

	<p style="text-align: center;">The claim that ethical practices differ among cultures, and what is considered right in one culture may be considered wrong in another. The implication of cultural relativism is that no one society is superior to another they are merely different. This claim comes with several corollaries; namely, that different societies have different moral codes, there is no objective standard to judge how good or bad these moral codes are, and that the job of those who study cultures is not to compare these customs to their own, but to describe them. Moral relativism claims that what is customary in a culture is absolutely right in that culture. Cultural relativism is not as strong, sometimes asserting that there is no real way to measure right or wrong. Cultural relativism is contrary to ethnocentrism, which encourages people to look at the world from the perspective of their own culture. While cultural relativism has been the subject of controversy — especially from philosophers — anthropological and sociological studies have led to a widespread consensus among social scientists that cultural relativism is true.</p>

	<h2>THE THREE THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE ON CULTURE</h2>
	</marquee>

	<h3><i>FUNCTIONALISM</i></h3>

	<p style="text-align: center;">The sees society as a system where each component contributes to the creation of society as a whole. Culture is necessary for societies to exist, and cultural norms serve to sustain society's adaptive functioning. People are guided by cultural values while making decisions, and because education is prized in the United States, it is a significant idea.</p>

	<h3><i>CONFLICT</i></h3>

	<p style="text-align: center;"> The believe that societal structures are intrinsically unequal because of power imbalances based on factors such as class, gender, race, and age. A conflict theorist sees culture as supporting "privilege" concerns for specific groups based on race, sex, class, and other factors. In a culture where men predominate, women work to achieve equality. Senior folks fight to defend their independence, rights, and access to healthcare against a younger generation of legislators.</p>

	<h3><i>SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONISM</i></h3>

	<p style="text-align: center;">The sociological viewpoint that is particularly interested in how people interact with one another in person. According to interactionists, culture is generated and preserved through interpersonal interactions and how people interpret one another's behavior. This theory's proponents view interpersonal interactions as an ongoing process of inferring meaning from both the environment's physical items and other people's behavior. The word "symbolic" is applicable here. Every action and thing has a symbolic meaning, and language is a tool used to represent and share these interpretations with others. According to symbolic interactionism, as culture depends on how meaning is interpreted and how people interact when expressing these, it is seen as being highly dynamic and fluid.</p>
