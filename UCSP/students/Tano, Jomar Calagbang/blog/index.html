                    Culture is a complex and multifaceted term that can be defined in various ways depending on the context. Generally, culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, symbols, language, and practices that characterize a particular group of people, such as a community, society, or nation. It encompasses the social norms, traditions, rituals, art, music, cuisine, clothing, and other aspects of life that are passed down from generation to generation within a specific group.

                <h3 style="color: orange; font-size: 40px;">ETHNOCENTRISM:</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 30px;">
                    Ethnocentrism is a concept in anthropology and sociology that refers to the tendency of individuals or groups to evaluate and judge other cultures or ethnic groups based on the standards, values, and beliefs of their own culture. It involves the belief that one's own culture or ethnic group is superior to others, leading to a biased and often negative view of unfamiliar or different cultures.

                <p style="font-size: 30px;">
                    Cultural relativism is the view that ethical and social standards reflect the cultural context from which they are derived. Cultural relativists uphold that cultures differ fundamentally from one another, and so do the moral frameworks that structure relations within different societies.
