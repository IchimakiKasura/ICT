                            Although I barely join the activites since I was the one <br>
                            who records the whole thing for the vlog which may come <br>
                            up soon and its about almost 40 minutes or even an hour long? <br>
                            <br>
                            I did enjoy them watching them do the activities whether its raining <br>
                            or not because it rained that day while doing one of our activities. <br>
                            <br>

                            Some activities are hilarious to watch like the vollyball one where <br>
                            the ball is so big and its funny to watch then play. <br><br>

                            My Experiences on the trip for a whole day was somewhat fun <br>
                            since it rained that day which makes the dirt turns into a <br>
                            mud which makes of our shoes goes full dirt brown and sticky. <br>
                            <br>
                            All in all, It's been 5 years since I last joined a fieldtrip <br>
                            because the last fieldtrip we went on Enchanted Kingdom which is <br>
                            yeah more fun since it's a theme park with tons of rides. <br>
                            <br>
                            While this year's fieldtrip is more focused on team building <br>
                            (even though I'm the one capturing them on video for a whole day) <br>
                            still I did participate on one activity course. <br>
                            <br>
                            Mostly my reason on why I can't really participate is that my <br>
                            asthma isn't fully gone yet so I can only just capture them <br>
                            and only participate on activites that doesn't require too much <br>
                            movements.
