		<td width="50%"><i><b>1989 (Taylor's Version) is the fourth re-recorded album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It is a re-recording of Swift's 
		fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and was released on October 27, 2023, by Republic Records. The album is part of Swift's ongoing response to a 2019 dispute regarding 
		the masters of her back catalog. It was announced at the final Los Angeles show of the Eras Tour on August 9, 2023. A 1980s-inspired synth-pop album, 1989 (Taylor's
		Version) is characterized by upbeat arrangements of synthesizers and percussion. It contains re-recorded versions of the 16 songs from 1989's deluxe edition and five
		previously unreleased "From the Vault" tracks.[a] Swift, Jack Antonoff, and Christopher Rowe produced the majority of the album; Ryan Tedder, Noel Zancanella, Shellback,
		and Imogen Heap reprised their production roles. Extended editions of the album additionally feature the re-recorded versions of the One Chance soundtrack song "Sweeter 
		than Fiction" (2013) and the Kendrick Lamar remix of "Bad Blood" (2015). Music critics praised 1989 (Taylor's Version), with emphasis on the production, Swift's vocals,
		and the vault tracks. Commercially, it earned the biggest streaming day for an album in 2023 on Spotify and of all time on Amazon Music. The album topped record charts
		in Australia, Canada, and European territories including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, 1989 (Taylor's Version) marked
		Swift's 13th number-one album on the Billboard 200, the biggest sales week of her career, her record-extending sixth album to sell over one million first-week copies, 
		and the highest vinyl sales week of the 21st century. Seven of its songs concurrently became top-10 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, with the vault tracks "Is It Over
		Now?", "Now That We Don't Talk", and "'Slut!'" occupying the top three spots.</b></i></td>
