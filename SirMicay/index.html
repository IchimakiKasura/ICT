                Holy Trinity Academy (HTA), also referred to as the Most Holy Trinity Academy, or colloquially as Holy, is a private parochial co-educational school in Sampaloc, Manila, Philippines. The school was established in June 1947 by Rev. Fr. Bernardo Torres. The school accepted both male and female students, but in separate departments, until it became fully co-educational in 1976.
                <br><br>
                The school currently maintains a Level 2 accreditation from the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU) since its approval in December 2015. The school is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila Educational System (RCAMES), an educational system and a group of catholic and parochial schools governed by Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila, where the school is under the fourth cluster, headed by the school's director, Rev. Fr. Marion C. Munda.
                <br><br>
                Holy Trinity Academy offers the K–12 curriculum program. In the Senior High School Department, the school offers five academic tracks, which prepares students for college and their chosen undergraduate program. In the school year 2019–2020, the school served a population of around 3,000 enrollees annually in its preparatory, elementary, and high school departments.
                <br><br>
                Some of the HTA alumni have been recognized for their works in arts, media, filmmaking, and science, including, Lexi Gonzales, Mon Gualvez, and Kyxz Mendiola.
